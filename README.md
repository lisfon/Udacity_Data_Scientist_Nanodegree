## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

With this project, which is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program of Udacity, I aimed at analysing the development of the programming industry over the past 5 years by comparing the results of the Stack Overflow Developer Surveys of 2015 and 2020.

The focus of my analysis are following questions:

1. Is the programming industry showing more gender diversity in 2020 compared to 2015?
2. Which programming languages are most common in 2020 and are they the same ones as in 2015?
3. Are programmers nowadays having a formal computer science background and has this changed since 2015?
4. Is programming a rewarding profession and has this changed since 2015?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository there is a Python notebook including comments that summarize the analysis performed.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
