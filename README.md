## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

With this project, which is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program of Udacity, I aimed at analysing the development of the programming industry over the past 5 years by comparing the results of the Stack Overflow Developer Surveys of 2015 and 2020.

The focus of my analysis are following aspects:

1. Gender diversity
2. Technical requirements
3. Job satisfaction

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository there is a Python notebook including comments that summarizes the analysis performed.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of my analysis can be viewed [here](https://lisa-fontana.medium.com/how-fast-is-the-programming-world-changing-b7dd79d5f25a).
